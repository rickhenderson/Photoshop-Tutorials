4. Set foreground to **Gold (250,200,50)** and background to **Brown (50, 40, 10)**
5. Select **Filter -> Render -> Clouds**
6. Save your work now and periodically
7. Select **Filter -> Filter Gallery -> Distort -> Glass** with the following settings
  * **Distortion: 20**
  * **Smoothness: 3**
  * **Texture: Frosted**
  * **Scaling: 140%**
  * *Do not invert*
  * Zoom out using the + and - signs in the lower left corner to see a better view of the whole texture. 
8. Change the Brightness and Contrast Settings
  * Click **Window -> Adjustments** to view the Adjustments Window
  * Click **Brightness/Contrast** (first tool in the first row)
